# PCI Compliance Access Review | Arvest Bank

## Objective

This project focused on strengthening PCI compliance by improving how Arvest Bank tracks and approves application access to sensitive PCI and PII data. The goal was to establish a more transparent and auditable access review process, reduce risk from excessive permissions, and ensure ongoing regulatory compliance.

### Skills Learned

- Practical understanding of PCI DSS compliance requirements  
- Conducting enterprise-level access reviews and permission audits  
- Interdepartmental communication and stakeholder collaboration  
- Process documentation for compliance and audit readiness  
- Risk identification and mitigation in data access pathways  

### Tools Used

- **Netskope** – to support cloud DLP monitoring and policy enforcement  
- **Configuration Management Database (CMDB)** – to identify application owners and map access paths  
- **Microsoft Excel** – for access mapping and data validation  
- **Internal ticketing system** – to trace historical access approvals  
- **Microsoft Teams & Outlook** – for communication and documentation sharing  

## Steps

⚠️ *Note: Due to the sensitive nature of this project, no screenshots or system diagrams are included.*

---

**Step 1: Access Data Collection**  
Reviewed access logs and compiled a list of applications with access to PCI/PII environments using the CMDB.

---

**Step 2: Access Justification Review**  
Cross-referenced current access with business need and ownership details to identify unnecessary or outdated permissions.

---

**Step 3: Stakeholder Coordination**  
Worked with application owners, IT, and compliance teams to verify or revoke access where needed.

---

**Step 4: Risk Identification**  
Highlighted access overlaps, missing approvals, and lack of expiration policies as potential compliance risks.

---

**Step 5: Process Improvement Proposal**  
Recommended a formalized access review cycle, clearer documentation practices, and expanded CMDB utilization to ensure continuous PCI alignment.
